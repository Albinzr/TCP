TCP
===

A simple TCP client for iOS written in Swift.

# Goals:

1. Learn swift by doing something real and useful.
2. Make it simple and easily extensible.
3. Eventually: try to make it fast, and add websocket support.

# Current Todos:

1. Optimize line delimiter writing.
2. Optimize writes in general by writing fewer and larger chunks, while maintaining the current <code>Writer</code> paradigm.
