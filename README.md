TCP
===

A simple TCP client for iOS written in Swift.

# Goals:

1. Learn swift by doing something real and useful.
2. Make it simple and easily extensible.
3. Try to make it fast.
4. Websocket?

# Current Todos:

1. Documentation.. :-)
2. Unify reader and TCPDelegate callback queues.
3. Optimize line delimiter writing.
4. Optimize writes in general by writing fewer and larger chunks, while maintaining the current <code>Writer</code> paradigm.
